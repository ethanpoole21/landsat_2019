test clock:

  a basic program that inits the RTC to the raspberry pi then accesses the features of the RTC

generate scatter:

  generates a random scatter plot as dummy data and outputs a CSV file

fit regression to scatter:

  takes an input CSV file and generates a plot with a linear regression line of best fit imposed onto the graph. also     calculates the r-square value to test the variability of the data. 
  
data visualizer:


  imports a CSV file in the form of LOGXXXXX output from a thermopile data collect. the data is appended at each of the 'break' sections of the file. vidualized the data in a subplot and extracts averages from each section. visualizes the averages on a seporate plot.
